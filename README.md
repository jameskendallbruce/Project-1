##Description
This application first presents the user with a search bar. The user can then enter any video game they would like to get reviews on. It then retrieves another page or dashboard. On this page it presents the user with live streams they can expand and watch, rating of the video game, top reddit posts, and recommended games. The user can click on  the link of the reddit posts to see each one. They can also click on a recommended image and it will take them to their sight. There is also a search bar in the top navigation bar if they would like to search another video game. The user can click on the top left logo to go back to the main search bar.
